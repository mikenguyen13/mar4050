## Examinations

Examinations will consist of

-   multiple choice

-   short essay questions

-   problems.

Makeup exams will be given only in cases of verified illness or in other extenuating circumstances approved at least one week beforehand by the instructor. Makeup exams are normally given during final exam week. An unexcused absence from an exam will result in a grade of zero for that exam.

<br>

## Group Term Project 

The group project is a small-scale marketing research project and includes problem definition, questionnaire design, data collection, data analysis, and writing up the research report. Each group will also give an oral presentation at the end of the semester. Group members will evaluate each other's performance on the project, and the evaluation will be considered in assigning individual students' grades for the project. If a group member consistently fails to contribute appropriately to the group's work, the other group members may request in writing to the instructor that the non-performing member be terminated from group. In such instances, the terminated group member will be allowed to use data collected by the group but will be required to complete remaining project assignments on his/her own, including data analysis, presentation, and final report. A terminated group member may appeal this decision to the instructor in writing, but must do so within **four calendar days of notice of dismissal**.

<br>

## Attendance, Participation, and Professionalism

-   This class meets in-person at the scheduled time slot.  Students are expected to be present at all class sessions and to participate by asking and answering questions at multiple points during each class session.  Failure to do so will result in loss of class participation and attendance points.  Both quality and quantity of contributions are considered in assigning the class participation grade.

-   To be excused due to illness, the student must either notify the professor before class of the illness, or provide the instructor with **a doctor's note**.

-   [Be on time to class]{.ul}. Important material is covered in the first few minutes of class. Students who are late to class will lose attendance points.

-   Students are expected to be prepared and to read assigned discussion cases before class begins. They are also expected to pay attention in class, and they will be called upon to present their views on class material and discussion cases. Students are also expected to contribute to the class by asking questions.

-   Professional behavior is expected of all students. Professionalism includes being on time, being courteous to class members and the instructor, being reliable and conscientious when working on group projects, and other aspects of behavior normally expected of students or employees.  

<br>

## Assignments

-   Assignments are to be turned in using Canvas and are due at the time noted on Canvas.

-   Late assignments are eligible for up to 50% of total points if they are turned in with 24 hours of the due date; after that, no credit will be given for late assignments. To be considered, any requests to re-grade an assignment must be made within one week after the grade has been posted on Canvas.

-   ***Project Assignments*** (PA) are described in the course packet immediately following the syllabus. They are to be completed by group members and turned in on the due dates shown.

-   ***Discussion Cases*** are [individual]{.ul} exercises to be completed on your own and form the basis for our class discussions. They need to be completed before class meets, and you will be called upon at various times throughout the semester to discuss your work on these exercises. Your work on these exercises will not be collected, but if you're unable to discuss your work when called upon, your participation grade will be negatively affected.

<br>

# Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is fundamental to the activities and principles of a university. All members of the academic community must be confident that each person's work has been responsibly and honorably acquired, developed, and presented. Any incident of academic honesty (such as cheating on tests or plagiarism) will be reported to the office of the provost. Academic dishonesty is an extremely serious matter with serious consequences, potentially including an automatic F for the course and probation or expulsion.

<br>

# Special Needs

If you have special needs as addressed by the Americans with Disabilities Act and need assistance, you must notify the instructor by the second week of the semester. To request academic accommodations, students must also register with Disability Services, AO38 Brady Commons, 882-4696. It is the campus office responsible for reviewing documentation provided by students requesting academic accommodations, and for accommodations planning in cooperation with students and instructors, as needed and consistent with course requirements.
